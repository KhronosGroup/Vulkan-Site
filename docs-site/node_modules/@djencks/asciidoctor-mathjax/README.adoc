= Server side MathJax rendering for Asciidoctor.js/Antora
:version: 0.0.8

`@djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax` provides an Asciidoctor.js extension to replace the built-in HTML asciidoctor stem processing with server-side rendering of AsciiMath and LaTeX Math expressions using the Mathjax 3 JavaScript library.
Output is inline SVG included in the final HTML document.
The intent is that configuration is identical to built-in stem processing.

Since MathJax stem support is not included in the Antora default UI, this may be a more convenient option for Antora than modifying the UI.

== Installation

Available through npm as `@djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax`.

The project git repository is: https://gitlab.com/djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax.js

== Usage in Asciidoctor.js

I am not a standalone Asciidoctor.js expert, so I will only quote one of the tests:

[source,js]
----
const mathJaxProcessor = require('@djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax')
const asciidoctor = require('@asciidoctor/core')()

const registry = mathJaxProcessor.register(asciidoctor.Extensions.create())
const html = asciidoctor.convert(`
:stem:

A matrix can be written as

[stem]
++++
[[a,b],[c,d]]((n),(k))
sqrt(4) = 2
sqrt(9) = 3
++++
`, { extension_registry: registry })

console.log(html)
----

== Usage in Antora

I've mostly used this with Antora upgraded to use Asciidoctor 2, but it seems to work fine using released versions of Antora.

Install this extension so it is visible to Antora.

=== Global installation

This is most useful if your project is not developed by a lot of people who need automated setup.

Run `npm i -g @djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax`.
This will fetch and install the extension usable in all your Antora projects.

=== Local installation

This provides automated setup for your project from a git clone, all your users have to do is run `npm i`.
However, while it provides more precise version control of your dependencies, it adds a node_modules directory in your playbook project.

Add a package.json file for your Antora project, next to the playbook.
Here's an example:

[source,json,subs="+attributes"]
----
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "antora antora-playbook.yml --fetch --stacktrace"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax": "^{version}"
  }
}
----

The script is unnecessary but convenient.
You can also list the antora cli and site-generator-default in devDependencies and use this to install Antora.

* Run `npm i` to install this extension
** With the above, run `npm run build` to run Antora to build your site.

=== Add the extension to the playbook

* List the extension in the antora playbook:
----
asciidoc:
  extensions:
  - '@djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax'
----

== Antora Example project

A fairly complete example project showing all the possible stem locations and configurations is under extensions/mathjax in `https://gitlab.com/djencks/simple-examples`.
