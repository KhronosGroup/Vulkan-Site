VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT - Structure describing whether device memory report callback can be supported by an implementation

The `VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT` structure is defined
as:

// Provided by VK_EXT_device_memory_report
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           deviceMemoryReport;
} VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT;

This structure describes the following feature:

* 
`sType` is a [VkStructureType](VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.

* 
`pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this
structure.

* 
 `deviceMemoryReport` indicates
whether the implementation supports the ability to register device
memory report callbacks.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the
[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to
[vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each
corresponding feature is supported.
If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](VkDevice.html) with any features
described by `VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure,
with the desired feature members set to [VK_TRUE](VK_TRUE.html), to the `pNext`
chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

* 
[](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT-sType-sType) VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceDeviceMemoryReportFeaturesEXT-sType-sType

 `sType` **must** be [VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_DEVICE_MEMORY_REPORT_FEATURES_EXT](VkStructureType.html)
